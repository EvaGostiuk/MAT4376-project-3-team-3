This folder contains the visualizations and supplementary code used to create said visualizations. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-3-team-3/blob/master/Tasks_1_2/Proj3.Rmd).

The data dictionary we created can also be found in our final PDF or [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17IvA-PzzZUNexGkVtO7XhCBO8_0ab7jI1joA-3qYwgg/edit?usp=sharing). All variables from the dataset are defined in the spreadsheet, but the variables included in the final PDF are those relevant to our work.
