The data dictionary we created can also be found in our final [PDF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NDnfiRG6j64BQKEROwSm7Z98MVTlKj03v_AD84ZN1XE/edit?usp=sharing) or [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17IvA-PzzZUNexGkVtO7XhCBO8_0ab7jI1joA-3qYwgg/edit?usp=sharing). All variables from the datasets are defined in the linked spreadsheet, but the variables included in the final PDF are those relevant to our work.

### Fun Facts For Collectable Papers

**AUC**: 

  * Did you know that a whopping 165,000 adventure-seekers took off on domestic flights bound for the marvelous country of Borealia, making it the hottest travel destination at the Auckland airfield? The runner-up, Vespuchia, had just a quarter of Borealia's flights, yet it still managed to attract a significant number of travelers with its irresistible charm.

  * Queenston emerged as the most popular city destination traveling from Auckland, with  the highest number of destined flights identified by the city codes QUE or BORQUE. As well, a significant number of international flights were dedicated to Vespuchia and Scotland.

  * Thursdays dominate any given week at the Auckland Airfield for jet setters, with a staggering 36,000 departures. Whereas Mondays take a more tranquil approach, with a modest 23,600 flights.

  * The Auckland airport is at its liveliest at 8 AM, with travelers taking off to various destinations. The excitement continues to surge at 7 PM and 8 PM. In contrast, the airport finds serenity during the early hours from 1 AM to 6 AM.

  * Expect to be scanned at 7 AM, as this is the most frequent time for S2 scans. This aligns with the typical departure time being an hour after they get through security. Interestingly, between 11 PM and 5 AM, there were no scans recorded at S2, suggesting a quieter period when the airport slumbered peacefully.

  * Did you know the number of agents might not always determine how long you'll wait? Most wait times stay below 40 minutes, regardless of whether there were 3 security agents or just 1. A few travelers also faced longer waits with fewer agents, but this wasn't the norm.

  * Don’t expect to wait that long at the Auckland airfield! The majority of the wait times were under 30 minutes, where most passengers experienced a quick passage through the queues with a mode of 2.5 minutes. 

**SAF**:

  * Over 1,700 flights landed in Vespuchia from the Saint Francois airfield, the country with the highest number of destined flights from SAF. There were almost double the amount of international flights than domestic flights out of this airfield. 

  * The two highest destined cities from flights that departed from SAF were in Vespuchia and made up over 53% of departures. 

  * Sundays were the busiest travel days for SAF and Tuesdays were the least busy travel days - if you’re looking to travel, we recommend traveling on Tuesdays for shorter lines and less crowded areas. 

  * The most flights departed the airfield at 10 AM and 12 PM, and the least flights departed 1 and 9 AM. 

  * If you’re looking for shorter lines at security, we recommend visiting between 6 PM and 4 AM as there were no reported S2 scans during that time period at SAF. 

  * On average, the more security agents at S2, the lower the time you’ll have to wait in line. 

  * The majority of passengers waited less than 16 minutes in line between S1 and S2 at the SAF airfield. 

**CWL**:

  * There was one flight that departed from the Chebucto airfield, scheduled to depart early in the morning on Christmas Eve 2026. 

  * Did you know that Chebucto was the second-highest destined city out of all the flights in the datasets? Even though only one flight departed from this airfield, almost 25,000 passengers arrived there.

  * Fun fact: there were 146 passengers that departed from the Auckland airfield on Halloween 2028 and landed in Chebucto. 

  * Did you know that there were only two years that flights were destined for the Chebucto airfield? All flights destined for Chebucto in 2030 left from the Saint Francois airfield and all flights destined for Chebucto in 2028 left from the Auckland airfield. 

**QUE**:

  * There were 7 flights that departed from the Queenston airport, of which all but 1 had S2 times occurring after the departure times.

  * Of the 7 flights, 6 of them were destined for Borealia and 1 of them was destined for Greece.

  * The 6 Borealia-destined flights all took off in December of 2026, possibly indicating that the Queenston airfield could be a holiday airfield for that year. 

  * Only 1 of the 7 flights departed on a weekend, the rest leaving the airfield on a weekday with the most common being Tuesday or Wednesday.  

  * Did you know that there were over 100,000 passengers that landed in the Queenston airfield in 2028 and 2030 combined? And of those 100,000 only 379 of them occurred in 2030.
