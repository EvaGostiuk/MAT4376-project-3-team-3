This folder contains the visualizations and supplementary code used to create said visualizations. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-3-team-3/blob/master/Tasks_1_2/Proj3.Rmd).

The data dictionary we created can also be found in our final [PDF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NDnfiRG6j64BQKEROwSm7Z98MVTlKj03v_AD84ZN1XE/edit?usp=sharing) or [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17IvA-PzzZUNexGkVtO7XhCBO8_0ab7jI1joA-3qYwgg/edit?usp=sharing). All variables from the datasets are defined in the linked spreadsheet, but the variables included in the final PDF are those relevant to our work.
